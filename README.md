The shield mod is **Meant to be PvE** mostly, but can be configured fully to make it easier on the **PvP side**. _(Less punishing)_

There is **Resourcepack support** for this mod! [**Enhanced Shield!**](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/enhanced-shield!/version/1.0) Puts the shield on the side to not clutter the screen so much!

## Mechanics
Being a **Rework** of course it expands the **Mechanics of the Shield** offering it more advantages for **Defending** as well as **turning the shield into a Offensive** Item **becoming a Weapon that can become deadly in certain scenarios**.

## Config
The mod offers alot of Customization options. Able to disable/enable stuns for different abilities, the duration of a stun when given, GUI icons to be moved around, as well as "Fun" options where Bashing in air can be Disabled/Enabled (this is left on by default so the Slam can be used in combination of Bash Vertical). Slam damage, radius and Shield Throw range and many more.

## HUD
The HUD has new Icons to show the Cooldown timers (which can be Edited between OFF, ONLY_COOLDOWN, ALWAYS_ON) It can be moved around (as a group) around the screen if it gets in the way of different mods and aswell as scaleable (can be slightly broken due to rushed coding sessions).

![Shield Icon Cooldowns](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/a1385183f30e2b3d31aa7c90c3d65f21f2d5481c.png)

The Icons can be customized via Resourcepacks (it is encouraged to do so, as the aim of this mod is to make it as customizable as possible and soon Sounds as well).

## Mod Support
The mod has "**Enchantment Descriptions**" support making it easier to learn the Enchants with **JEI** or **REI** _(or just identifying it in inventory)_

## Mod Blacklist
By **default** the mod will not react.

_(such as a Bug where if the shield is in Offhand and you're aiming down sights and with a gun and shooting, the shield will Bash forward. Blacklist fixes that.)_

If an item is present in the **Main hand** from the **Mod ID** that's included in the "Compatability" category it will not react. Meaning it **disables the shield** for the meantime.

The category add is slightly broken for now (will get fixed soon as I add the Item Blacklist)

## Quality of Life Updates
It wouldn't be a good Rework if the Stupid issues weren't removed from the vanilla game such as Animation Shield delay.

- By default, the 5 tick delay animation is now Completely removed, making the shield instant as soon as the server obtains the ping.
- The Shield can now be enchanted directly through the Enchantment Table.
- The Shield supports minecraft enchants such as "Loyalty" (Loyalty is needed for Shield Throw to work, if it doesn't exist it will not Throw itself at all.) and Piercing (basically allows the Shield throw to go through Multiple entities upon being thrown.
- Advancements Meant to instruct the player on what the Shield can do.

# Note
The mod is Inspiried by Other shield systems combined into one mod to fix all the issues and add more features to make it Fun for Traveling or Fighting bosses in Modpacks.

It is Highly recommended to Install "Better Combat" along with "First person Model" mod to play this as it has been Aimed towards it to make it more convenient to Fight Monsters (or any mob/entity) and make it fun, specially with LevelZ.

I am aware that the Combat Feedbacks are still poor (Sound design, Stun Indications and Environmental Changes) This will be fixed in future updates when i get the time for it so.

# Mod Loaders

This mod will Only support fabric as it's too much for for me as One developer to maintain the Shield mod across all Versions of the game (and on top of that adding Multiple loaders.)

### Mod Dependencies
Fabric API, Cloth Config, Mod Menu.
